# The Inoue Method for Preparation and Transformation of Competent E. Coli: "Ultra-Competent" Cells

### Joseph Sambrook and David W. Russell  
This protocol was adapted from *Molecular Cloning, 3rd edition*, by Joseph Sambrook and David W. Russell.

## INTRODUCTION
This protocol reproducibly generates competent cultures of *E. coli* that yield **1 x 10⁸ to 3 x 10⁸ transformed colonies/µg** of plasmid DNA. Optimal results are achieved when the bacterial culture is grown at **18°C**. If a suitable incubator is unavailable, a standard bacterial shaker can be placed in a 4°C cold room and regulated to 18°C.

## MATERIALS
- **DMSO**: High grade (HPLC grade or better).
- **Inoue transformation buffer**: Chilled to 0°C before use (see Step 1).
- **Plasmid DNA**: Construct using methods such as *Directional Cloning into Plasmid Vectors* or *Blunt-ended Cloning into Plasmid Vectors*.
- **SOB agar plates**: Containing 20 mM MgSO₄ and the appropriate antibiotic.
- **SOB medium**: For growth of culture to be transformed.
- **SOC medium**: Approximately 1 ml per transformation reaction.

## MEDIA RECIPES
### SOB Medium
| Reagent           | Amount               |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| NaCl              | 0.5 g               |
| Tryptone          | 20 g                |
| Yeast extract     | 5 g                 |
| Deionized H₂O     | To 950 ml           |

1. Dissolve solutes and add **10 ml of 250 mM KCl**.  
2. Adjust pH to **7.0** with 5 N NaOH.  
3. Adjust volume to 1 L with deionized H₂O.  
4. Autoclave for 20 minutes.  
5. Add **5 ml of sterile 2 M MgCl₂** before use.

### SOC Medium
SOC is identical to SOB but contains **20 mM glucose**.  
After autoclaving SOB medium, add **20 ml of sterile 1 M glucose** (filter-sterilized).

## METHOD
### 1. Prepare Inoue Transformation Buffer
1. Prepare **0.5 M PIPES (pH 6.7)**: Dissolve 15.1 g of PIPES in 80 ml of pure H₂O. Adjust pH with 5 M KOH and bring volume to 100 ml. Sterilize by filtration.
2. Prepare the transformation buffer as follows:

| Reagent               | Amount per liter | Final Concentration |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| MnCl₂•4H₂O            | 10.88 g         | 55 mM              |
| CaCl₂•2H₂O            | 2.20 g          | 15 mM              |
| KCl                   | 18.65 g         | 250 mM             |
| PIPES (0.5 M, pH 6.7) | 20 ml           | 10 mM              |
| H₂O                   | To 1 liter      |                     |

3. Sterilize by filtration and store at -20°C.

### 2. Grow Bacterial Culture
1. Pick a single bacterial colony from a plate (incubated for 16–20 hours at 37°C).  
2. Transfer the colony to **25 ml of SOB medium** in a 250-ml flask.  
3. Incubate at **37°C** with vigorous shaking for **6–8 hours**.

### 3. Overnight Growth at 18°C
1. Use the starter culture to inoculate **three 1-liter flasks** containing 250 ml of SOB.  
   - Flask 1: 10 ml starter culture.  
   - Flask 2: 4 ml starter culture.  
   - Flask 3: 2 ml starter culture.  
2. Incubate overnight at **18–22°C** with moderate shaking.

### 4. Harvesting Cells
1. Measure OD600 of all three cultures. When one reaches **0.55**, place it on ice for **10 minutes**. Discard the other two cultures.  
2. Centrifuge at **2500g** for 10 minutes at 4°C. Remove all medium.  

### 5. Resuspension and Freezing
1. Resuspend cells in **80 ml of ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer**.  
2. Repeat centrifugation and resuspend in **20 ml of Inoue buffer**.  
3. Add **1.5 ml of DMSO**, mix, and store on ice for **10 minutes**.  
4. Aliquot into sterile tubes and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store at **-70°C**.

## TRANSFORMATION
### 1. Thawing Competent Cells
1. Thaw a tube of competent cells in the palm of your hand and transfer to an ice bath.  

### 2. Adding DNA
1. Add transforming DNA (up to **25 ng per 50 µl** of competent cells). Gently mix.  
2. Incubate on ice for **30 minutes**.

### 3. Heat Shock
1. Place the tubes in a **42°C water bath** for **90 seconds**.  
2. Transfer to ice for **1–2 minutes**.

### 4. Recovery and Plating
1. Add **800 µl of SOC medium**. Incubate at **37°C** with shaking for **45 minutes**.  
2. Plate up to **200 µl** on SOB agar containing 20 mM MgSO₄ and antibiotic.  

### 5. Incubation
1. Incubate plates at **37°C** for **12–16 hours**.
